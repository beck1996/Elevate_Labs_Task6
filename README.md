this repo is related to Password being Strong or not and what should be the right combination to make it strong 


1. Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity

   | Password          | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `hello123`        | Simple, lowercase + numbers                    |
| `HelloWorld123`   | Mixed case + numbers                           |
| `H3ll0!W0rld`     | Mixed case, numbers, symbols                   |
| `@X9p#Z8$2kLm`    | High complexity, symbols, upper/lower, numbers |
| `pass`            | Very weak, short, all lowercase                |
| `Myp@ssW0rd!2025` | Complex, longer, mix of all elements           |


2. Use Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, Length Variations
Done in the above list. Ranges from very simple (pass) to very complex (@X9p#Z8$2kLm).

3 & 4. Test Each Password on Password Meter

| Password          | Strength Score | Feedback                              |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `hello123`        | Weak           | Too common, easy to guess             |
| `HelloWorld123`   | Medium         | Better, but still guessable           |
| `H3ll0!W0rld`     | Strong         | Good use of substitutions and symbols |
| `@X9p#Z8$2kLm`    | Very Strong    | Complex, hard to crack                |
| `pass`            | Very Weak      | Too short and common                  |
| `Myp@ssW0rd!2025` | Strong         | Personalized but complex enough       |



5. Identify Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Use at least 12 characters.

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid common words or sequences (e.g., “password”, “1234”).

Use passphrases or random word combinations with complexity.

Do not reuse passwords across sites.



6. Tips Learned from Evaluation
Longer is stronger: More characters = more secure.

Random is better: Avoid dictionary words or patterns.

Substitutions help, but only if the base word is not obvious.

Avoid personal info like names, DOB, or common phrases.

Use a password manager to create and store complex passwords safely.



7. Common Password Attacks

   | Attack Type             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brute Force**         | Tries all possible combinations until the password is found. |
| **Dictionary Attack**   | Tries passwords from a precompiled list of common passwords. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked passwords to try across other sites.             |
| **Phishing**            | Tricks user into giving away the password.                   |
| **Keylogging**          | Malware records keystrokes to capture passwords.             |



8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security
Simple passwords (short, common words) can be cracked in seconds using brute force or dictionary attacks.

Complex passwords (long, random, mixed character types) are exponentially harder to crack.

Adding just one character to your password dramatically increases the number of combinations.

Properly complex passwords can take centuries to brute-force with current computing power.
